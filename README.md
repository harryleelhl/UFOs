# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time and table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


## Results
To create a user interactive webpage that allows users to parse data of recorded UFO sightings as an analysis by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Table filters are used for the date, city, state, country, and shape. And, to build a filtering engine with: 1) a webpage that will allow users to view the data (using HTML), and 2) a dynamic table that will present the information (using JavaScript and HTML).


## Summary
The current method of coding only include proper spacing, abbreviations, syntax, and date time structure, which is not too flexible for adding additional creiteria

Two recommendations for further development would be to allow flexibility in the way texts are entered (ex. upper/lower case) for the search criteria
