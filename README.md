# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana construct a website that allows users to read and search about UFO sightings

## Results
A person may utilize the new webpage's search criteria by entering in the filter search boxes. Users may search by Date, City, State, Country, and/or Shape. The format of the search must follow the format indicated on the page. An example, or placeholder, is already in the search box, making it easy for the user to follow along. Please see image below for a screenshot of the webpage as well as the search functions available on the left side of the webpage:

## Summary
One drawback of this new design is that it utilizes exact matches, including proper spacing, abbreviations, syntax, and date time structure. Two recommendations for further development would be to allow flexibility in the way texts are entered (ex. upper/lower case) for the search criteria. Additionally, it may be a good idea to add back the filter button that we had previously deleted for a more user friendly interface.
